> Description

- `Open To Public`: Whether this group is open to all users to use, or only `Owners` use
- `Cluster Mode`: Whether this Group is managed as a cluster (with cluster scheduling and other clustering functions), this feature requires the site administrator to open the `Enable Cluster Mode` on the` System Config` page
- `Owners`: If Open To Public is not enabled, only the configured User can operate this Group
- `Server`: `Server Name` and` IP` should fill in one or both, and use IP access first
