# User Management

Under the Administration menu, on the User-Related page, you can manage users.  

In the User tab, you can edit existing users or add new ones.  

In Humpback, there are only two user roles: `Admin` and `User`. 

Admins can use all functions under Administration and manage all Service Groups.  

In the Team tab, you can edit existing Teams or add new ones.  

In Humpback, Services are managed based on Groups. By assigning authorized users and Teams to a Group, effective permission isolation can be achieved.
